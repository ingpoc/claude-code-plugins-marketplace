### 🤖 Interactive Architecture Agent
> **Problem:** Traditional AI coding agents make assumptions and over-engineer without asking questions  
> **Solution:** Question-first approach that asks clarifying questions, explores incrementally, and documents decisions

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Never makes assumptions - always asks before deciding
- ✅ Explores codebase incrementally (one functionality at a time)
- ✅ Presents options with trade-offs - you choose the approach
- ✅ Learns your conventions - documents decisions in CLAUDE.md
- ✅ MVP-aware - adjusts recommendations based on project stage

**Perfect for:** Teams building MVPs who want conscious architectural decisions instead of accidental technical debt.
