   - Issues detected: 0 problems
   - Risk level: LOW (nice to have)

🎯 Project Stage Detection:
   • README mentions "MVP launch in 2 weeks"
   • Test coverage: 31%
   • No production deployment yet
   • Several TODO/FIXME comments found
   
📋 Recommendation Priority:
   A) Authentication (foundational - affects everything)
   B) Payment Processing (critical for revenue)
   C) Shopping Cart (user experience impact)
   D) Product Catalog (stable, fewer issues)
   E) Email Notifications (working well)

❓ Which functionality should I explore first?
   A) Follow recommended priority (Authentication)
   B) Start with most critical for revenue (Payments)
   C) Start with quickest win (Email - already working)
   D) You decide the priority order

💡 My Recommendation: Start with Authentication since any issues here cascade to all other features. If auth is broken, nothing else matters.

👤 Your choice: [A/B/C/D]
```

**You type:** `A`

### Step 2: Deep Dive into Authentication

```
🤖 Exploring Authentication Module...

📁 Structure Analysis:
   • Routes: authRoutes.ts (3 endpoints)
   • Middleware: authMiddleware.ts (JWT validation)
   • Services: AuthService.ts (business logic)
   • Models: User.ts (Sequelize model)
   • Utils: jwtHelper.ts, passwordHelper.ts

🔍 Pattern Analysis:
   • Error handling: Mixed approaches (inconsistent)
   • Validation: Some endpoints validate, others don't
   • Security: Basic JWT implementation
   • Testing: 4 test files, covers happy paths only

⚠️ Issues Discovered (Priority Order):

🔴 CRITICAL Issue #1: JWT Security Vulnerability
   Problem: JWT tokens never expire (no expiresIn set)
   Impact: Stolen tokens work forever
   Files affected: jwtHelper.ts line 23
   
🔴 CRITICAL Issue #2: No Rate Limiting
   Problem: Login endpoint has no rate limiting
   Impact: Vulnerable to brute force attacks
   Files affected: authRoutes.ts
   
🟡 MEDIUM Issue #3: Inconsistent Password Validation
   Problem: Register endpoint validates, reset doesn't
   Impact: Weak passwords can be set via reset flow
   Files affected: AuthService.ts lines 45, 89

Let's address the critical issues first...
```

### Step 3: Interactive Problem Solving

```
🤖 Critical Issue #1: JWT Token Expiration

📋 Current State:
   • JWT tokens generated with no expiration
   • Code: jwt.sign(payload, secret) // Missing expiresIn option
   • Risk: If a token is compromised, it's valid forever

🎯 Context:
   • This is for a production e-commerce app
   • Users will have payment methods and personal data
   • Security breach = customer trust + legal liability

💡 Solution Options:

A) Set 1-hour expiration (industry standard for security)
   ✅ Pros: Secure, limits damage from stolen tokens
   ❌ Cons: Users need to re-login more frequently
   ⏱️ Implementation: 15 minutes
   💰 Cost: Minor UX friction
   
B) Set 24-hour expiration (balance security vs UX)
   ✅ Pros: Better user experience, still reasonable security
   ❌ Cons: Longer exposure window if compromised
   ⏱️ Implementation: 15 minutes
   💰 Cost: Moderate security risk
   
C) Implement refresh token mechanism (1hr access + 7d refresh)
   ✅ Pros: Best security + UX, industry best practice
   ❌ Cons: Complex implementation, new endpoints needed
   ⏱️ Implementation: 4 hours
   💰 Cost: Development time, complexity

📊 Your Codebase Context:
   • Currently using simple JWT
   • No refresh token infrastructure exists
   • Team size: You mentioned "small team, fast iteration"

🎯 Project Context:
   • MVP launch in 2 weeks
   • You mentioned "get to market fast, improve later"

🧠 Claude's Analysis:
   For MVP launch: Option A (1-hour expiration)
   For post-MVP: Plan upgrade to Option C
   
   Reasoning: Option A gives you security NOW with minimal code changes (just add expiresIn: '1h'). You can implement refresh tokens in your next sprint without breaking existing users.

❓ Questions for you:
   1. Your choice: [A/B/C]
   2. Should I also create a TODO item for implementing refresh tokens later?
   3. How do you want to handle the user experience when tokens expire?

👤 Your response: _____________________
```

**You type:** `A - 1 hour expiration. Yes, add TODO for refresh tokens. Show user a "session expired" message with easy re-login.`

### Step 4: Implementation & Documentation

```
🤖 ✅ Implementing JWT 1-hour expiration...

🔧 Changes Made:
   • Updated jwtHelper.ts: Added expiresIn: '1h' to jwt.sign()
   • Updated authMiddleware.ts: Better error handling for expired tokens
   • Added user-friendly error messages for token expiration
   • Created TODO.md with refresh token implementation plan

📝 Code Changes:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   const token = jwt.sign(payload, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
   
   // After
   const token = jwt.sign(payload, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { 
     expiresIn: '1h',
     issuer: 'ecommerce-api'
   });
   ```

📚 Documentation Updated:
   • Updated CLAUDE.md with JWT expiration policy
   • Created ADR-001: JWT Security Implementation
   • Added API documentation for token expiration behavior

🧪 Testing Added:
   • Unit test for token expiration
   • Integration test for expired token handling
   • Manual verification: confirmed 1-hour expiry works

📊 Impact Analysis:
   ✅ Security vulnerability eliminated
   ✅ No breaking changes to existing API
   ⚠️ Client apps must handle 401 responses gracefully
   📈 Test coverage: 31% → 34%

✨ Ready for next critical issue?
   
🔴 Next: Rate Limiting on Authentication Endpoints
   Problem: No protection against brute force attacks
   
   Continue? [Y/N]: _____________________
```

**You type:** `Y`

### Step 5: Next Critical Issue

```
🤖 Critical Issue #2: Rate Limiting

📋 Current State:
   • No rate limiting on /auth/login endpoint
   • Attackers can attempt unlimited login tries
   • Could overwhelm your server or crack passwords

🎯 Attack Scenarios:
   • Brute force: Try common passwords against user emails
   • Credential stuffing: Use leaked email/password pairs
   • DoS: Overwhelming login attempts crash your service

💡 Solution Options:

A) Simple in-memory rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 min per IP)
   ✅ Pros: Quick to implement (30 min), no new dependencies
   ❌ Cons: Resets on server restart, doesn't work with load balancers
   🛠️ Tool: express-rate-limit package
   
B) Redis-based rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 min per IP)
   ✅ Pros: Persistent, works with multiple servers, production-ready
   ❌ Cons: Requires Redis dependency
   🛠️ Tool: express-rate-limit + redis store
   
C) Advanced rate limiting (by IP + by email, progressive delays)
   ✅ Pros: Sophisticated protection, harder to bypass
   ❌ Cons: Complex implementation, potential UX issues
   🛠️ Tool: Custom implementation

🔍 Your Infrastructure Analysis:
   • I found docker-compose.yml with Redis already configured
   • You're already using Redis for session storage
   • Team familiarity: Redis is in your tech stack

🧠 Claude's Recommendation: Option B (Redis-based)

   Reasoning: You already have Redis running and configured. This adds production-grade rate limiting without new infrastructure. Takes 1 hour vs 30 minutes for Option A, but gives you something that won't break when you scale.

❓ Follow-up Questions:
   1. Your choice: [A/B/C]
   2. Should I also add rate limiting to /auth/register and /auth/reset endpoints?
   3. What should happen when someone hits the rate limit? (Error message? Temporary lockout?)

👤 Your response: _____________________
```

**You type:** `B - Redis rate limiting. Yes, add to all auth endpoints. Show "Too many attempts, try again in 15 minutes" message.`

### Step 6: Continuing the Process

```
🤖 ✅ Implementing Redis-based rate limiting...

🔧 Implementation Complete:
   • Added express-rate-limit with redis store
   • Applied to all auth endpoints: /login, /register, /reset
   • Configured: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
   • User-friendly error messages with retry time

📊 Authentication Module Review Summary:

✅ Issues Resolved:
   • JWT token expiration: 1 hour (security fixed)
   • Rate limiting: Redis-based protection (brute force prevented)
   • Password validation: Standardized across all endpoints
   • Error handling: Consistent approach implemented
   • Logging: Added security event logging

📈 Metrics Improvement:
   • Security score: 3/10 → 8/10

   • Technical debt: 3 issues documented in TODO.md

📋 Decisions Documented in CLAUDE.md:
   • JWT expiration: 1 hour policy
   • Rate limiting: 5 attempts/15min via Redis
   • Error handling: Standardized error responses
   • Password policy: 8+ chars, complexity requirements

⏭️ Next Functionality Review:

🎯 Which should we review next?
   A) Payment Processing (2 critical issues detected)
   B) Shopping Cart (2 medium issues detected)
   C) Take a break - test authentication changes first
   D) Generate security report for stakeholders

💡 Recommendation: Option A (Payment Processing) since it's revenue-critical and has detected issues.

👤 Your choice: [A/B/C/D]

## Key Differences from Traditional AI Agents

| Traditional AI Agent | Interactive Architecture Agent |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| **"I'll fix the JWT security issue using industry best practices"** | **"I found a JWT security issue. Here are 3 options with trade-offs. For your MVP timeline, I recommend Option A. What's your choice?"** |
| **Implements refresh tokens** (assumes you want complexity) | **Asks if you want 1hr, 24hr, or refresh tokens** (respects your constraints) |
| **Uses MongoDB because it's popular** | **Notices you already have Redis configured - should I use that instead?** |
| **No memory between sessions** | **Documents decisions in CLAUDE.md for future sessions** |
| **Fixes everything at once** | **Focuses on one functionality at a time** |

## The Result: Conscious Technical Debt

Instead of accidental technical debt ("Why did the AI choose this?"), you get conscious technical debt ("We chose 1-hour JWT for MVP, upgrading to refresh tokens in Sprint 3").

**This is the difference between building fast and building smart.** 🚀
