## 🎯 Problem Solved

Testing web applications is complex because you need to:
- Manage multiple servers (frontend, backend, database)
- Run different types of tests (API, E2E, performance, security)
- Analyze and prioritize complex test results
- Clean up resources properly after testing
- Handle server failures and recovery

## 🚀 Solution: Autonomous Testing Agent

This plugin implements a comprehensive testing system that:

✅ **Manages entire server lifecycle** - Starts, monitors, and cleans up all services  
✅ **Runs comprehensive test suites** - API, Frontend, E2E, Performance, Security  
✅ **Provides intelligent reporting** - Prioritized recommendations with specific fixes  
✅ **Handles multi-environment testing** - Development, staging, production  
✅ **Recovers from failures** - Automatic error handling and resource cleanup  
✅ **Integrates with existing tools** - Jest, Playwright, Lighthouse, Docker  

## 🏠 Architecture

### Core Agents

1. **Server Manager** - Handles server lifecycle, dependencies, and environment setup
2. **Test Reporter** - Analyzes results and generates comprehensive, actionable reports
3. **Autonomous Web App Tester** - Coordinates the entire testing process

### Workflow: The Complete Testing Cycle

```

## 📦 Installation

1. **Copy the plugin to your Claude Code plugins directory:**
   ```bash
   cp -r plugins/web-app-testing-agent ~/.claude-code/plugins/
   ```

2. **Restart Claude Code**

3. **Enable the plugin in settings**

## ⚙️ Configuration

Add to your Claude Code settings:

```json
{
  "webAppTestingAgent": {
    "testScope": "comprehensive",
    "timeout": 30000,
    "retries": 2,
    "browsers": ["chromium", "firefox"],
    "skipSecurity": false,
    "skipPerformance": false,
